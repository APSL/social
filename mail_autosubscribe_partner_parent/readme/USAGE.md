When creating a selected autosubscribe record, it adds the partner parent in copy of it.

For example, if you have invoice selected on mail_autosubscribe_ids:

Go to Invoicing > Create a new Invoice > Select the wanted partner > Confirm the invoice

The parent partner will be automatically added in copy of the invoice.
